        Penetration Testing for FINRA
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a not-for-profit organization that regulates broker-dealers and their personnel in the United States, plays a pivotal role in providing guidance on best practices for financial firms to protect their systems and data. In 2024, FINRA published a report that examines and provides recommendations to member firms with rich insight into findings from its Member Supervision, Market Regulation and Enforcement program. These guidelines and recommendations provide greater transparency to member firms and the public about regulatory and compliance activities. While FINRA itself does not prescribe a specific penetration testing (pentesting) requirement, firms must adhere to general cyber security standards as part of their compliance obligations under FINRA Rule 4370 (Business Continuity Plans) and FINRA Rule 3110 (Supervision). With financial firms facing persistent threats of phishing, insider threat activities, and common vulnerabilities due to branch office controls, it is important for firms to maintain a strong cyber security framework capable of deploying vigilant and robust defensive and proactive measures.
