        "There are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be hacked‚Äù states Robert Mueller, former Director of the FBI emphasizing on the evolving intricate domain of cyber-security . As modern technology relentlessly pushes the boundaries of innovation breaking new frontiers, every organization increasingly becomes a potential target for malicious hackers. This rapid advancement not only opens up new opportunities but also exposes vulnerabilities that cyber-criminals are eager to exploit. Maintaining robust security measures has evolved from being merely important to absolutely essential for operational integrity.
