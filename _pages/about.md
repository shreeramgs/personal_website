I am a software engineer at [White Hack Labs, New York](https://whitehacklabs.com/), currently working on building agentic frameworks for cybersecurity use cases ([HackerGPTLite](https://hackergpt.app/auth/login)). I completed my Master's in Data Science from the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/), Buffalo, NY and my Undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at [The National Institute of Engineering](https://nie.ac.in/) , Mysore, KA.

I am passionate about exploring topics in AI, Computer Vision, Cyber Security and Data Science. I previously, worked as a research assistant at [Center for Unified Biometrics Lab](https://www.buffalo.edu/cubs.html), focusing on Computer Vision challenges in Biometrics (Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection and Synthetic Fingerprint Generations).

My most recent research contribution involved creating the novel dataset [GestSpoof](https://www.buffalo.edu/cubs/research/datasets/gestspoof-dataset.html) which is now publicly available [cubs-gestspoof@buffalo.edu].
